## Singlash-Web
We developed a telegram chatbot and a web application game, called Singlash, inspired by Quiplash and Khaoot! The game asks the user to head to the telegram chatbot where they must be creative and key in the funniest Singlish phrase which best describes a gif which pops up on the chatbot. The chatbot then translates the Singlish phrase to English and a suggested answer pops up. If the chatbot is incorrect, then the user can input the correct translation.

Then, all data is automatically uploaded on a spreadsheet and visualised on a website to show the most popular and funniest singlish phrase based on user voting. Overall, we used the Telegram Bot API, Imgur API, CloudConvert API, AI Singapore API, Google Sheets API, Chart.js API, Flask and Firebase.
