Singlash-Web

We developed Singlash, a game inspired by Quiplash and Kahoot! It is a telegram bot and a web application game integrated using multiple APIs. All you need to do is generate your room ID and head to telegram and key in your inputs and a game will be generated instantly! You will need to be creative, to think of the funniest Singlish answer and submit it via your voice. Based on your input, a suggested answer will be prompted but you will be able to input the corrected version. All data from the players will be automatically uploaded into a spreadsheet, a highly effective format for analysis as it is easier to port into ML models. Overall, we used the Telegram Bot API, Imgur API, CloudConvert API, AI Singapore API, Google Sheets API, Chart.js API, Flask, Firebase.
